<h2>The Chef’s Hat Game<a class="headerlink" href="#the-chef-s-hat-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>![Chef’s Hat Card Game](gitImages/ChefsHatAlgorithm.png)</p>
<p>During each game there are three phases: Start of the game, Making Pizzas, End of the game. The game starts with the cards been shuffled and dealt with the players. Then, starting from the second game, the exchange of roles takes place based on the last games’ finishing positions. The player who finished first becomes the Chef, the one that finished second becomes the Sous-Chef, the one that finished third becomes the Waiter and the last one the Dishwasher. Once the roles are exchanged, the exchange of the cards starts. The Dishwasher has to give the two cards with the highest values to the Chef, who in return gives back two cards of their liking. The Waiter has to give their lowest valued card to the Sous-Chef, who in return gives one card of their liking.</p>
<p>If, after the exchange of roles, any of the players have two jokers at hand, they can perform a special action: in case of the Dishwasher, this is “Food Fight” (the hierarchy is inverted), in case of the other roles it is “Dinner is served” (there will be no card exchange during that game).</p>
<p>Once all of the cards and roles are exchanged, the game starts. The goal of each player is to discard all the cards at hand. They can do this by making a pizza by laying down the cards into the playing field, represented by a pizza dough. The person who possesses a Golden 11 card at hand starts making the first pizza of the game. A pizza is done when no one can, or wants, to lay down any ingredients anymore. A player can play cards by discarding their ingredient cards on the pizza base. To play cards, they need to be rarer (i.e. lowest face values) than the previously played cards. The ingredients are played from highest to the lowest number, that means from 11 to 1. Players can play multiple copies of an ingredient at once, but always have to play an equal or greater amount of copies than the previous player did. If a player cannot (or does not want) to play, they pass until the next pizza starts. A joker card is also available and when played together with other cards, it assumes their value. When played alone, the joker has the highest face value (12). Once everyone has passed, they start a new pizza by cleaning the playing field, and the last player to play an ingredient is the first one to start the new pizza.</p>

<h2>The IAgent Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#the-iagent-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can create a new agent by implementing the iAgent interface. Each new agent must implement the getAction() and getReward() functions, which are necessary to mantain the common gameflow. To create a valid agent, the getAction() function must return a one-hot encoding for the 200 allowed actions. The getReward() must return a float number with the agent’s reward.</p>
<p>Besides these methods, each agent can implement the following methods:</p>
<table border="1" class="colwidths-auto docutils" id="id1">

<tr class="row-even"><td>observeOthers</td>
<td>It will be called as soon as any of the opponents makes an action</td>

<h2>Chef’s Hat Players Club<a class="headerlink" href="#chef-s-hat-players-club" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Besides the naive random agent present on the Chef’s Hat environment, we also let available the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatPlayersClub">Chef’s Hat Player’s Club</a>, a collection of ready-to-use players. Each of these agents where implemented, evaluated and discussed in specific peer-reviewed publications and can be used at any time. If you want your agent to be included to the Player’s Club, send us a message.</p>
