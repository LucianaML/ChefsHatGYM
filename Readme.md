This repository holds the OpenGYM environment for the Chef's Hat card game.
For more information about the card game itself, please read out paper:

" It's Food Fight! Introducing the Chef's Hat Card Game for Affective-Aware HRI " - https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11458

This environment is freely available for scientific purposes and implements all the rules and mechanics of the Chef's Hat game.

**Pre-requisites**

Install the requirements from the Requirements.txt file.

**Instructions**

We let available here two files: one with an example on how to run the GYM environment using a set of Random Agents or a Deep Q-Learning Agent.
This example creates all the logs, plots and saves the training models. It also allow the generation of datasets that hold the game steps.

The generateVideos file can read these datasets and generate rendered videos from the gameplays.
